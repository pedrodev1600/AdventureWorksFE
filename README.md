# AdventureWorksApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.2.

I have created this application to showcase my angular and dev extreme abilities

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

I have created a small dashboard page with some sales headline figures in cards at the top and a top 10 sales territitories table that allow you to drill in and see the product sales and overall sales for a territory.

I have also created a product list view which is fully searchable in which you can drill into a prodcut for editing.  You can also add a product from the product list screen.

The product add edit screen in minimal but does show how I would handle the CRUD operations in angular
